# Creates an OSD and adds it to given Ceph deployment using ceph-deploy.
#
# Specially usefull when need to deploy an OSD over a LUKS device, given that
# ceph-volume deprecated the use of --dmcrypt parameter, thus ceph-deploy
# fails wonderfully when trying to use it, and the same happens when a mapper
# device is given. This script handles any block device by manually creating
# the LVM layer.
